Wunnel
======

This is the reference distribution of Wunnel, an esoteric programming
language.

At present, it contains:

*   the specification of the language, copied from [Wunnel article][] on
    the esolangs.org wiki.  (Which is in the public domain and was mostly
    written by me anyway.)
*   the [yoob][] implementation of Wunnel.
