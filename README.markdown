Wunnel
======

This is the reference distribution of Wunnel, an esoteric programming
language.

At present, it contains:

*   the specification of the language, copied from [Wunnel article][] on
    the esolangs.org wiki.  (Which is in the public domain and was mostly
    written by me anyway.)
*   an implementation of Wunnel in HTML5, using [yoob.js][].

It's all in the public domain; see the file UNLICENSE for more information.

There is also a public-domain implementation of Wunnel in Java included
in [the yoob distribution](https://github.com/catseye/yoob).
